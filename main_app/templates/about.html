        <p class="lead text-center">Apiary is a social event web application that aims to help people connect with others by allowing them to create, browse, and attend events, called "hives". Apiary provides a platform where users can discover and join events that interest them, and where event organizers can create and manage their events with ease.
            
            Our mission is to help people find and attend events that they are passionate about. We believe that connecting people through shared interests is the key to building strong and vibrant communities. Our goal is to provide a platform where users can discover new events, make meaningful connections, and share experiences with others.
